 - Uses [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) for state management and [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) for basic routing.
 
 - Table filtering, sorting and pagination through URL query params
 - Leverages [redux-form 6.1.x](http://redux-form.com/6.1.0/), along with form validation for creating new data entries
 - State is persisted in Local Storage. 
 - Used Bootstrap CDN and font awesome for styling purposses.
